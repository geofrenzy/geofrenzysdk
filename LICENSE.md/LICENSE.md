or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to any Licensee Disclosure. Such Licensee Disclosure

any such Licensee Disclosure will be non-confidential. GEO will be free to use and disclose any Licensee
Disclosure on an unrestricted basis without notifying or compensating you. You release GEO from all

Licensee Disclosure. Any physical materials you submit to GEO will become GEO property and GEO will have

or termination hereof: 1, 2, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 4 through 18 (inclusive).
11.
No Warranty. You agree that the SDK and its components are provided “as is” and that GEO and
its licensors make no other warranty as to the SDK, including, but not limited to, uninterrupted use,
accuracy, and data loss. GEO and its licensors disclaim all other warranties, express or implied, including
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, privacy, security, non-infringement and
fitness for a particular purpose (even if GEO knows or should have known of such purpose), related to the
SDK, its use or any inability to use it, the results of its use and this Agreement. GEO and its licensors do
not warrant that the SDK or any results of use thereof will be free of defects, errors or viruses, reliable or
able to operate on an uninterrupted basis or in a particular environment or that errors therein, if any, will
be corrected.
12.
Limitation of Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by law, GEO and its affiliates and licensors
shall not be liable for any damages, whether in contract or tort (including negligence) or any other legal or
equitable theory, arising from this agreement, including without limitation any indirect, consequential,
special, exemplary, incidental damages, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. You agree that
you shall have the sole responsibility for protecting your data, by periodic backup or otherwise, used in
connection with the SDK. In any case, GEO and its affiliates and licensors’ sole liability and your exclusive
remedy under any provision of this Agreement shall be the replacement of the SDK (or portion thereof)
found to be defective, with the exception of death or personal injury caused by the negligence of
GEO, and solely to the extent applicable law prohibits the limitation of damages in such cases.
13.
Indemnification. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and
hold harmless GEO, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and
against any and all claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or accruing from: (a) your use of
the SDK, including Third-Party Software and/or Documentation; (b) any Application you develop on or
with the SDK that infringes any patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property or proprietary
right of a third party; and (c) your noncompliance with any term of this Agreement.
14.
Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” shall mean the SDK and all other information disclosed
to you by GEO that would reasonably be considered to be confidential, or is or was considered by GEO to
be confidential, except for information which you can demonstrate: (a) is previously rightfully known to
you without restriction on disclosure; (b) is or becomes, from no act or failure to act on your part,
generally known in the relevant industry or public domain; (c) is disclosed to you by a third-party as a
matter of right and without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by you without
access to the Confidential Information.
You shall use your best efforts to preserve and protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information
at all times, both during the term hereof and for a period of at least 3 years after termination of this
Agreement, provided, however, that any source code you receive shall be held in confidence in perpetuity.
You shall not disclose, disseminate, or otherwise publish or communicate Confidential Information to any
person, firm, corporation or other third-party without the prior written consent of GEO. You shall not use
any Confidential Information other than in the course of the activities permitted hereunder. You agree to
use your best efforts to prevent and protect the contents of the SDK from unauthorized disclosure or use.
You shall notify GEO in writing immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of
Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement, and will cooperate with GEO in every
reasonable way to regain possession of Confidential Information and prevent any further unauthorized
use.
If you are legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, then, prior to such disclosure,
you will (i) immediately notify GEO prior to such disclosure to allow GEO an opportunity to contest the
disclosure, (ii) assert the privileged and confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and (iii)
cooperate fully with GEO in protecting against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order
narrowing the scope of such disclosure and/or use of the Confidential Information. In the event such
protection is not obtained, you shall disclose the Confidential Information only to the extent necessary to
comply with the applicable legal requirements.
15.
Injunctive Relief. You acknowledge and agree that your breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement shall cause GEO irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be
inadequate and that GEO therefore may obtain timely injunctive relief to protect its rights under this
Agreement in addition to any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.
16.
Export Controls. The SDK and the underlying information and technology may not be downloaded
or otherwise exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the U.S.
has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated
Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders. By downloading or using the SDK
and/or Documentation, you are agreeing to the foregoing and you represent and warrant that you are
not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list and
you agree to comply with all export laws and other applicable laws.
17.
Miscellaneous. (a) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
concerning the subject matter hereof, which may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an
authorized executive of GEO. (b) Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to
this contract, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof
or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and
finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with Section 18 below. This Agreement shall not be governed
by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. (d) If any part of this
Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part shall be construed to reflect the parties' original
intent, and the remaining portions remain in full force and effect, or GEO may at its option terminate this
Agreement. (e) The controlling language of this Agreement is English. If you have received a translation
into another language, it has been provided for your convenience only. (f) A waiver by either party of any
term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, shall not waive such term
or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. (g) You may not assign or otherwise transfer by operation
of law or otherwise this Agreement or any rights or obligations herein. GEO may assign this Agreement to
any entity at its sole discretion. (h) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
18.
MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. BY ELECTING
ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED
THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD IN COURT AND
WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING CLASS CLAIMS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS ARE
MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of SDK, or to any products or services sold or distributed
by or on behalf of GEO will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may
assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law
apply to this agreement.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an
arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and
declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this End User License Agreement as a
court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to;
Geofrenzy, Inc
39 Main Street
Tiburon, CA 94920
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the
AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at
adr.org/consumer or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the
arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, GEO will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in
arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration
conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at
another mutually agreed location.
We each agree that any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis between you and GEO and
not in a class, consolidated or representative action or arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court
rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring
suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. If part of this provision is
unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.
19.
User Outside the United States. If you are using the SDK outside the US, then the following shall
apply: (a) You confirm that this Agreement and all related documentation is and will be in the English
language; (b) you are responsible for complying with any local laws in your jurisdiction which might impact
your right to import, export or use the SDK, and you represent that you have complied with any regulations
or registration procedures required by applicable law to make this license enforceable.
